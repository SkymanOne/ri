# Status

Progress against the milestones in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Each milestone is delivered as a vertical slice: its exit criterion is met on the subset stated here, and what remains is listed. Intentional differences from pi are in [compat.md](compat.md); everything below is either done or not yet done.

Differential results come from the scenario suite (`cargo xtask e2e`), which compares ri with pi `v1.0.0` on the same cassettes.

## M0: workspace, types, mock server

Done.

- Workspace, CI on Linux and macOS, `cargo deny`.
- `ri-types` reads and writes every pi golden file byte-identically.
- `ri-mock` replays cassettes; `cargo xtask mock-sse` serves one to any client, or records one through a proxy with credentials redacted (`--record`).

## M1: wire APIs, print and JSON modes

Done for the slice below.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Wire APIs | `anthropic-messages`, `openai-completions` (all thinking formats and compat flags), `openai-responses`, `google-generative-ai` |
| Catalog | pi-ai 1.0.0 catalog embedded by `cargo xtask models`; `models.json` overrides and custom providers |
| Credentials | `--api-key`, `auth.json` (`!command`, `$VAR`), `models.json` `apiKey`, environment, ambient AWS and Vertex credentials |
| Modes | Print (`-p`) and JSON (`--mode json`); piped stdin; `@file` arguments |
| CLI | pi's argument parser, `--list-models`, `--help` |

Differential scenarios (all match pi): text, thinking, tool calls with result turns, HTTP errors, mid-stream errors, incomplete and max-token stops, piped stdin with a thinking suffix, model listing.

Not yet done:

- Live cassettes. The OpenCode Go key cannot reach `opencode.ai` from this environment; all cassettes are hand-written from the providers' documented stream formats.
- OpenAI grammar-constrained custom tools; such tools are sent as function tools.
- Image resizing and BMP conversion before upload.
- GitHub Copilot dynamic headers, Anthropic workload identity federation.
- Abort scenarios (cancellation is implemented and unit-tested, but has no differential scenario).

## M2: agent loop, tools, sessions

In progress.

Done:

- Agent loop with parallel tool execution, steering and follow-up queues, `AgentHooks`.
- Tools `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write` with pi's truncation, fuzzy edit matching and mutation queue.
- System prompt sections, context files, skills, prompt templates, settings with project trust.
- Session manager: JSONL v3 tree, migration, branching, fork, clone, context edits, projection.
- Post-run recovery as in pi: auto-retry with backoff, omission of failed and truncated attempts, overflow recovery, threshold compaction with split-turn summaries, manual compaction.

Differential scenarios: auto-retry exhausted, auto-retry recovered, length stop, threshold compaction.

Not yet done: `grep`, `find`, `ls`; branch summaries; `--continue`, `--resume`, `--session`, `--fork` scenarios; session file interop in both directions.

## M3 to M7

Not started.

## Pending live checks

These need the user's credentials and run outside CI:

- OpenCode Go recording (Anthropic, Completions and Responses routes), once `opencode.ai` is reachable.
- OAuth sign-in with real subscription accounts (M4).
